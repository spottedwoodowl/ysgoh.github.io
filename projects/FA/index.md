Here’s what might be wrong or could be improved in your provided content:

1. Inconsistent Tone & Clarity
"Yield Impact Failure" is vague and negative-sounding without context. Consider rephrasing to clarify if this was a challenge you addressed or a problem you solved.

Better: "Addressed Yield Impact Challenge" or "Solved Yield Impact Issue"

2. Missing Context for "30 kHz Resonance"
The note about "30 kHz resonance" lacks explanation. Is this a success, a problem, or a measured outcome?

Better: "Identified and mitigated 30 kHz resonance interference" or "Achieved stable 30 kHz resonance for optimal performance."

3. Passive Voice in "Implemented the best optimized..."
It’s unclear who took the action. If this is your achievement, use active voice.

Better: "Designed and implemented an optimized write current profile, reducing write clearance by X%."

4. Image Issues
The src path uses {{ site.baseurl }}, which may not render correctly if this is static HTML (e.g., in a Markdown file).

The alt text (alt="30 Khz") has a typo (Khz → kHz).

The figure caption ("Figure 30Khz") is unclear—describe what the image shows (e.g., "Figure: 30 kHz resonance measurement").

5. Backlink Formatting
The "Back to Main Site" link also uses {{ site.baseurl }}, which may not work outside of Jekyll/Liquid templates. For static sites, use a direct path (e.g., /index.html).

Key Improvements:
Clarity: Added context to achievements.

Accuracy: Fixed units (kHz) and image references.

Professionalism: Active voice and measurable results.

If this is for a Jekyll site, ensure site.baseurl is properly set in your config. For static HTML, use absolute/relative paths.
